# 👋 Hi, I'm Meshal Nayim

I'm an incoming Master's student in Data Science at UC San Diego with a strong interest in applied AI, deep learning, and intelligent automation. My portfolio includes several impactful projects ranging from AI-powered resume screening systems to document understanding pipelines and analytics dashboards for business operations. I’ve worked on end-to-end automation using cloud platforms, LLMs, and workflow orchestration tools.

My undergraduate research focused on transfer learning and image authenticity detection using convolutional neural networks, with a special focus on synthetic images generated by diffusion models. This work earned a Best Paper Award at IACIS IEEE conference. In addition, I have hands-on experience in building scalable data engineering solutions using Spark and Databricks to support analytics in the electronics retail domain.

I’m passionate about bridging the gap between research and real-world deployment — combining data engineering, machine learning, and automation to solve practical problems.
